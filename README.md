### Memory Game - My First React App

Yippee!

### Overview
* The application renders different imagesto the screen and each image listens for click events.
* It also keeps track of the user's score which gets incremented when clicking an image for the first time and it resets to 0 if the user clicks the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
